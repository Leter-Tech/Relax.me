## üéØ **Problem Statement**

Mental health issues are more common than we often acknowledge. Anxiety, burnout, overthinking, and emotional overwhelm affect people across all age groups ‚Äî not always in extreme ways, but often subtly, consistently, and cumulatively. Left unaddressed, even minor emotional strain can compound into something much more difficult to manage.

The core problem is that emotional regulation isn't intuitive for most people ‚Äî and we‚Äôre rarely taught how to manage our thoughts, track our emotions, or calm ourselves down during moments of distress. When someone feels anxious or scattered, they usually don‚Äôt have structured tools nearby to help them slow down, reflect, or feel supported.

This gap creates a silent problem: people needing help, but not knowing where to turn ‚Äî or not feeling like their needs are ‚Äúbig enough‚Äù to seek formal care.

**Relax.me** was built to fill that space. A place where users can process their thoughts, regulate their breathing, understand their emotional patterns, and reach out when needed ‚Äî all without judgment, complexity, or noise. It‚Äôs about making emotional care **personalized, effective and accessible** for everyday life.
